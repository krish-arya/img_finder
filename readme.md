# ðŸ§  AI-Based Image Matcher App

A powerful deep learning app built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a **query image**, match it against multiple **reference images**, and return the most visually similar ones using a pretrained **ResNet50** model. The app supports side-by-side comparisons, renaming matched images, and downloading them in a ZIP file.
